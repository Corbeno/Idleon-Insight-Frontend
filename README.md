# Idleon Insight Frontend <a href="https://idleoninsight.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/Corbeno/Idleon-Insight-Frontend/blob/main/public/insightLogo.png?raw=true" width="30" height="30" /></a>

This repo is for the frontend portion for https://idleoninsight.com, which displays parsed game data and makes it searchable for the videogame Idleon. 

The code that does the parsing can be found [here](https://github.com/Corbeno/Idleon-Insight)

## Searching
The search feature accepts Regex and basic string searches (if invalid regex is applied). The following are examples of searches that might be useful:
https://idleoninsight.com/?search=weapon.*power

https://idleoninsight.com/?search=skill.*xp

https://idleoninsight.com/?search=money%7Ccash

Whenever you make a search, the URL is automatically updated to match, so you can share the results with your friends!

## Can I use the same data set for my own website?
Yes! Head on over to the [Idleon Insight](https://github.com/Corbeno/Idleon-Insight) repository, which has instructions on how to use the JSON yourself.
## I found something that is missing!
If you find anything in the game that isn't in this list, please create a Github issue. It doesn't have to be long or descriptive, just let me know!
You can also make the changes yourself and create a pull request if you would like.
